## Introducci√≥n:
This workshop is designed within the pharmaceutical industry environment to demonstrate JavaScript skills using TypeScript. It explores the fundamental concepts of TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features. The workshop showcases best practices and modern tools, improving the quality and maintainability of code in pharmaceutical applications.

Objectives:

Demonstrate the fundamentals of TypeScript and its basic syntax.
Show how to set up a TypeScript project.
Apply best practices in dependency management and tool configuration.
Implement advanced concepts such as classes, interfaces, and asynchronous programming in TypeScript.
Highlight the differences and advantages of using TypeScript in JavaScript projects.

## Packages
### typescript
TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability. It helps catch errors early during development, making the codebase more robust and easier to refactor.

### ts-node
Ts-node allows TypeScript files to be run directly, eliminating the need for a separate compilation step during development. This streamlines the workflow and speeds up the development process.

### @types/node
Provides TypeScript type definitions for Node.js, ensuring accurate type checking and better developer experience through IntelliSense support in editors.

### express
Express is a fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js, used to build APIs and microservices. It simplifies routing, middleware management, and request handling.

### @types/express
Provides TypeScript type definitions for Express, ensuring type safety and improved developer productivity by enabling IntelliSense and code completion.

### nodemon
Nodemon automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected, which enhances development efficiency by eliminating the need to manually restart the server.

### dotenv
Dotenv loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. This is essential for configuring environment-specific settings securely and conveniently.

### tsyringe
TSyringe is a dependency injection library for TypeScript. It helps manage class dependencies in a clean and maintainable way, promoting modular and testable code architecture.

### @types/validator
Provides TypeScript type definitions for the validator library, which includes functions for string validation and sanitization. This ensures type safety and better code quality.

### sequelize
Sequelize is an ORM for Node.js that supports multiple SQL databases. It simplifies database interactions by providing an abstraction layer for database queries and transactions.

### reflect-metadata
Reflect-metadata enables the use of decorators and metadata reflection in TypeScript, which is crucial for advanced TypeScript features like dependency injection and ORM integration.

### sequelize-typescript
Sequelize-typescript adds TypeScript support to Sequelize, allowing for type-safe ORM operations and improving code maintainability in database interactions.

### jsonwebtoken
Jsonwebtoken is a library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens, commonly used for secure authentication and authorization in microservices architectures.

### @types/jsonwebtoken
Provides TypeScript type definitions for jsonwebtoken, ensuring accurate type checking and enhancing developer experience through better tooling support.
